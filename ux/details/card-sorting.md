practice: "This exercise is based on Fiorella Rizza’s article [How I taught Information
  Architecture to aspiring UX Designers](https://uxdesign.cc/how-i-taught-information-architecture-to-aspiring-ux-designers-281ce61de42f).\n\n1.
  Start by duplicating [this list of cities](https://whimsical.com/XBqWS16BhxNSXxQ8y9fbjU#7YNFXnKbYf5A4mKsXtJTN)
  in Whimsical.\n2. Individually, using cards and stacks, perform an **open** card
  sorting exercise, creating categories (stacks). Once finished, \U0001F4E5 save a
  screenshot (or export) of your results.\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_2DDFF30F389174483ABF518CA44EA6A98F2DF4509B64C1975E468B16FE9C5270_1566840705738_image.png)
  \ \n_Use “Stacks” in Whimsical Sticky Notes to create a group._\n\n3. Remove the
  cards from the stacks and shuffle\n4. Find someone outside of your cohort to perform
  a card sort with.\n5. Using the categories you created, perform a **closed** card
  sorting exercise. Once finished, \U0001F4E5 save a screenshot (orexport) of your
  results.\n\nHow did the results of the open and closed card sort differ? How do
  the results compare to your expectations?"
activity:
  content: "Decide which type of card sorting method (open, closed, hybrid) you want
    to use. Using *Whimsical Sticky Notes,* perform the card sorting method for your
    app with at least 3 people. Remember to \U0001F4E5 document the final results
    of each round, and to ask your participants why they made certain choices.\n\n\U0001F4E5
    Synthesize your learnings from the three (or more) participants into some general
    guidance you can take with you into the Navigation lesson.\n\nAs a result of this
    exercise, you may find that you need to update your user flow. Go ahead and update
    what you need to, and \U0001F4E5 include comments explaining your changes. In
    the next lesson, you’ll update your navigation wireframes."
  submission_instructions: |-
    1\. Whimsical Board(s) or other artifacts of at least three participants

    2\. Updated user flows, with comments explaining changes

    3\. Synthesized learnings

    4\. Your response to the reflection prompt

During the _Wireframing_ section, you likely created some initial iterations of your app’s navigation. In the next lesson, we’ll focus purely on navigation. Now, we’ll step out of our wireframes for a moment to explore two research techniques: _Card Sorting_ and _Tree Testing._

To get started, read [**4 Research Techniques for Website Redesigns**](https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/research-techniques-for-website-redesigns/). For a more in-depth explanation and some practical tips, read Optimal Workshop’s[ **Card Sorting 101**](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/101/card-sorting).

These techniques will provide you with research artifacts that will inform your navigation structure.

Oh, and whatever you came up with for navigation during _Wireframing_? Be ready to throw that away. A designer’s first solution is rarely the best solution! And even if it is, you’ll only know it’s the best after exploring all other possible approaches.
